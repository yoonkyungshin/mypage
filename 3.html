<h2>JavaScrip</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> often abbreviated as <u>JS</u>, is <strong>a programming language</strong> that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
  JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
  It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top:50px;">JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers,
  but they are now embedded in server-side website deployments, usually via Node.js.
  They are also embedded in a variety of applications
  created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.</p>
